# About The Project

This project aim to create the mobile application for our MobleHCI 2022 project. The application will be the middle-man that connect a smart cane to a pair of smart glasses. This connection would also prove beneficial by processing proximity data and crowd meter levels in order to send audio triggers via the speakers on the eyewear. Additionally, this project would allow it's user to utilize the touchpad sensors(gestures) and microphone in an effort to gain GPS location data.
